# Unleashed (Pico8 game)

Unleashed is a casual infinite runner created for the [Pico8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) where you play as a dog getting chased by its owner. The further you get without getting caught, and the more bones you collect along the way, the higher your score. As simple as that.

## Demo

Here is a small demo where you can see the dog running, dodging obstacles, collecting bones, and eventually getting caught by its owner after colliding with a car:

P.S. Yes, this PNG image contains the entire game. Pretty neat if you ask me. ðŸ˜Ž

## About this project

Developing this game was a lot of fun! The limitations of the Pico8, technical and otherwise, make developing for this [fantasy console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console) a very entertaining challenge. Plus, I personally find the retro aesthetic of the IDE and the Pico8 games very cool and charming.

Unfortunately, I don't think the game is as fun to play as I would have liked, as some of its mechanics are a little bit clunky, in my opinion. Not only that, but the code is a total disaster, so by the end of development I kinda hated my own creation. ðŸ™ˆ

As anyone can see, the game itself isn't that complex (it's quite simple, actually), but little by little its code grew into a convoluted mess that ended up occupying more than 8k tokens â€“ I didn't even try to be mindful of the number of tokens because I naively assumed that I would never need them all, yet here we are.

Part of the problem was that I knew/know very little about Lua and Pico8, which was made worse by the fact that I am too lazy to learn things properly, as I prefer to just wing it. However, apart from my own incompetence, I believe that the main issue was that the project changed directions a hundred times during development, resulting in the messy code you can see here.

In any case, enough with the negatives. As I mentioned at the start, working on this project was a blast, so I might still come back to the Pico8 in the future with some fresh ideas and some lessons learned.
